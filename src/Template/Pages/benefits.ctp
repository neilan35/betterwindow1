                    <p>Plastic windows can help prevent children injuries and protect your home against burglary. Standard windows are equipped with accessories that prevent thieves from breaking-in, removing the window or pushing it out and opening it on the outside. To improve safety for children, we install accessories that only allow opening the window for ventilation purposes but prevent from opening it fully.</p>
